Dynamic problem is a way to solve the problem by breaking it down to subproblem and solving 
each subproblem adn storing the solution 

Memoization:  specific type of caching. it is a way to remember a solution to a subproblem 
so u dont need to calculate it again.

caching: way to speed of program and hold data in an easily accessible box

*writes down “1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =” on a sheet of paper*
“What’s that equal to?”
*counting* “Eight!”
*writes down another “1+” on the left*
“What about that?”
*quickly* “Nine!”
“How’d you know it was nine so fast?”
“You just added one more”
“So you didn’t need to recount because you remembered there were eight!
 Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say ‘remembering stuff to save time later'”
