*****************************************Substring****************************************************
(continious)  

A substring is a contiguous(continuous) sequence of characters present within a string. 
It is a string present inside a string.

For instance, the substrings of the string “tree” would be: 
If you carefully see, you will notice that the number of substrings 
of a string of length N is equal to (N*(N+1))/2. {without including empty string}

't,' 'r,' 'e,' 'tr,' 'tre,' 'tree,' 're,' 'ree,' 'ee' and. ''

While finding the substring of a string, we must keep in mind that:-

An empty string is also a substring of the given string.
If the string has a character repeated twice as in the above example of “tree,” 
we have 'e' repeated twice, so 'e' will be counted only once as a substring.

******************************************Subarray*************************************************
(continious)

Arrays can be denoted by curly brackets {} or square brackets [].

The example below gives a clear view of the subarrays of an array:

int array[ ] = {1, 5, 4};

Therefore, subarrays for the array {1,5,4} are {1}, {1,5}, {1,5,4}, {5}, {5,4}, {4} and {}

*****************************************Subsequence***********************************************
(non continious)

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence of elements 
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

In other words, it's a generalised subarray/substring where the rule of contiguity 
does not apply. So, a subsequence can be derived from another sequence by deleting 
some or none of the elements in between but always maintaining the relative order of 
elements in the original sequence.

For example: {A, B, D} is one of the subsequences of the sequence {A, B, C, D, E} 
obtained after removing {C} and {E}.

Let us consider another example where we will see all subsequences of an array:

 int array[ ] = {5,6,7,8};

The subsequences are:

 {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {5,6}, {5,7},{5,8}, {6,7}, {6,8}, {7,8}, {5,6,7}, {5,6,8}, {5,7,8}, 
 {6,7,8}, {5,6,7,8}, {}. 

The total number of subsequences of an array or string of length N is 2N 
(includes the empty subsequence).

Notice that any element of an array or string can be a part of a particular subsequence or not. So there are 2 possibilities for every element.

Hence the total count will be 2 x 2 x 2 ….. N times = 2N .
