In Greedy Algorithm a set of resources are recursively divided based on the maximum,
immediate availability of that resource at any given stage of execution.

To solve a problem based on the greedy approach, there are two stages

These stages are covered parallelly in this Greedy algorithm tutorial, 
on course of division of the array.

To understand the greedy approach, you will need to have a working knowledge of recursion
and context switching. This helps you to understand how to trace the code. 
You can define the greedy paradigm in terms of your own necessary and sufficient statements.

Two conditions define the greedy paradigm.

Each stepwise solution must structure a problem towards its best-accepted solution.
It is sufficient if the structuring of the problem can halt in a finite number of greedy steps.
