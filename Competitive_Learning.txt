So here is my overview what i learn from competitive programming:

1] Using leetcode when the solution is not working it is cause of your printing 
   returning new elements we should only return nums or any value that is given in
   problem not the one we initialised.

   so for ex:
   if def(nums,i->list):
   then u should do nums.clear()  that will clear the list given in problem
   then u can append the list with another one that u initialiseed before.
